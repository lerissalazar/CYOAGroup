        You really want Taco Bell but it's only a 10 minute walk, and gas prices have been very high recently so you decide to take advantage of the weather right now. It seems really sunny outside, no change of rain so you decide not to check your weather app and take the chances, putting on some shorts and a t-shirt. It's good to get some excericise in before you eat your Nacho Fries box with a Crunchwrap Supreme, Chicken quesadilla and a large Baja Blast. You finally leave your house and start your walk, all is going good and you're finally 5 minutes away.
